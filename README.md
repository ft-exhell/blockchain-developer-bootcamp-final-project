# Crypto Briefing User Authentication

## Project Description

Crypto Briefing is a media company that focuses on delivering quality coverage of the latest news in the blockchain space. We also have a research-focused branch SIMETRI, which has a subscription service.

This app is a mockup demo of an authentication service that will enable SIMETRI subscribers access website material by using their web3 wallets. 

The target chain is Polygon. Rationale: low fees and an NFT marketplace (OpenSea) for lifetime subscriptions.
